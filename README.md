# Satellite-Based Maritime Intelligence System
A computer vision system that analyzes satellite imagery to detect ships, assess traffic density, identify hotspots, and generate actionable maritime intelligence.

A computer vision pipeline that detects, classifies, and analyzes ships in satellite imagery using YOLOv8. It provides congestion assessment, military/civilian classification, risk scoring, clustering alerts, and visual heatmaps.

## Analysis Modules

### Ship Counting
Counts total detected ships and breaks them down by class using YOLOv8 detection results.

### Congestion Level
| Ships | Level |
|---|---|
| < 5 | Low |
| 5 - 14 | Medium |
| >= 15 | High |

### Military / Civilian Classification
Ships are mapped to pre-defined class lists and counted separately. Unrecognized classes are flagged as Unknown.

### Risk Level
| Condition | Risk |
|---|---|
| No military ships | Low |
| Military < 30% of total | Medium |
| Military >= 30% of total | High |

### Unusual Clustering
Computes pairwise distances between ship centers. If any two ships are closer than 50 pixels, a clustering alert is raised.

### Alert System
| Condition | Alert |
|---|---|
| Military + High congestion | CRITICAL ALERT |
| Military present | WARNING: Military presence |
| High congestion only | WARNING: Heavy traffic |
| Otherwise | Normal activity |

## Training Your Own Model

This system uses a standard YOLOv8 model. To train on your own ship dataset:

```bash
yolo detect train data=ship_data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
```

Point `--weights` to your output `best.pt` when running the pipeline.




## Future Improvements

- Multi-frame ship tracking
- AIS (Automatic Identification System) integration
- Real-time satellite feed processing
- Geospatial coordinate mapping
- DBSCAN-based maritime clustering
- Streamlit/Web dashboard deployment
- Temporal anomaly detection
